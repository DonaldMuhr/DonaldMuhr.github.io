		<h2>Why Plant Prairie?<sup>1</sup></h2>
				
		<p>POLLINATION - Prairies provide essential food and shelter for native pollinators—bees, wasps, beetles, flies and butterflies. Besides the long and diverse flowering season, they also offer aboveground shelter year-round when much other vegetation has been removed. Researchers estimate that a third to a half of native tallgrass prairie bees are plant specialists, meaning they only feed on specific plant species or families.</p>
		
		<p>CLIMATE ADAPTABLE - Most prairie plants can survive extreme dry as well as wet conditions. As climate patterns become increasingly dramatic, prairie vegetation is more likely to survive extreme weather events than other plants.</p>
		
		<p>CARBON SEQUESTRATION - Native plants work much better than traditional mowed grass as a carbon sink due to their extensive root systems and capacity for retaining and storing water. Their capacity to store carbon can help reduce global warming.</p>
		
		<p>SUPPRESS PEST INSECTS - Prairie insects are natural enemies to many pest insects, reducing the need and cost for pesticides or other costly management.</p>
		
		<p>PREVENT EROSION - The root systems of prairie grasses can grow 6-8 feet deep or more (most lawn grasses have roots less than 4 inches deep) so they can hold soils even on very steep inclines and prevent reservoirs from filling up with sediment.</p>
		
		<p>WATER CONSERVATION - Prairie plants can survive long periods of dry weather. Some die back and grow only when water sources are rejuvenated. Even if aboveground growth is damaged, their roots store energy for regrowth. Their roots also greatly increase water absorption and help recharge groundwater supplies.</p>
		
		<p>IMPROVE AIR QUALITY - Ground level ozone and air toxics can be drastically reduced by the elimination of  lawn maintenance equipment—lawn mowers, weed edgers, leaf blowers, etc.—fueled by gasoline, electricity or batteries.</p>
